### What is cryptocurrency?

Crypto coins are digital currency, that is, they are created on a computer, and it serves as the means of payment used for transactions in blockchains. So that neither coins nor transactions can be forged, these are encrypted, hence the name cryptocurrency.

### What is a blockchain?

All transactions made with crypto currency are placed in special blocks of information, along with the order in which each block is added to the chain. Tens or even hundreds of transactions made by users of the blockchain are placed in a block, and those are encrypted by special nodes that are called miners.

### What are crypto miners?

They are computers that are in charge of encrypting the blocks added to the blockchain, and in exchange for their service, they receive coins as a reward, that can be used to purchase goods or services.

### How to get a miner?

Miners are computers with a special mining program, that are responsible for connecting to the Internet, and searching for all pending transactions. Once a miner is able to code all transactions it is rewarded with crypto coins that the owner of the node can use.

### What is Nimiq?

Nimiq is the easiest to mine and use cryptocurrency there is, as it does not require a specialized mining program, or a program to make transactions. Nimiq, also known as NIM, can be mined directly from the web browser, and the mined coins are immediately available for using from the web browser itself.

### Why should I use Nimiq?

NIMs can be exchanged for other crypto coins such as bitcoin and ethereum, or even for traditional currency such as the dollar. Unlike other crypto coins though, NIMs are much easier to mine or to use for transactions, as everything is done directly from the web browser, or even from smartphones. Also, NIMs do not require a bank account in local or foreign currency, or to make transfers in cash, and their value is defined in relation to more stable currencies like the dollar, so changes in the value of local currencies do not affect the value of NIMs.

### How can I start mining Nimiq?

Easy! You just need to:

1. Get a computer with a web browser, it can be Windows, Linux or Mac, or even a mobile device running Android or iOS, and go to the Internet address https://miner.nimiq.com

2. Click on the button Let's Go, which opens a window to create your account where you will receive your NIMs.

3. Choose one of the seven images displayed in hexagons randomly generated, which will serve as your customized icon for your account address.

4. Once you have chosen your icon select the CONFIRM button, and enter the six-digit password that you will use to access your account each time you wish to use it. You will be asked to enter the password a second time to confirm that it was correct.

### Done...! Nimiq mining just like that

A world map with small hexagons indicating the active peers in the blockchain network should have appeared on the web browser window. In the statistics shown below, MY HASHRATE indicates the amount of computations the miner is performing for the blockchain.

There is also an option at the bottom called MINING POOL, which is recommended to activate as it will allow you to receive the NIMs you are mining more quickly.

### What are mining pools?

Mining pools are groups of miners working together as a team to encrypt blocks added to the blockchain more quickly. Every time a miner in the pool encrypts a block, all miners receive a share of the reward for their service. Although rewards for mining in a pool are smaller than for solo mining, they are received more regularly, so you don't have to wait too long to receive them. On average the rewards of mining in a pool are generally speaking the same as those of solo mining, the difference is a small fee taken by the node that manages the pool, which is usually less than 1%.

If you want to participate in a mining pool you just need to choose one of those available in the MINING POOL option at the bottom of the browser window.
